# Kotlin Basics

Welcome to **Kotlin Basics** — a repository created for my personal learning journey as I explore the fundamentals of the Kotlin programming language.

This repo contains simple programs, syntax explorations, and small practice exercises.  
Feel free to browse, learn, or use the code. If you need any help or resources related to Kotlin, I’m glad to assist!

## What This Repo Covers
- Kotlin syntax and structure  
- Variables, data types  
- Functions and classes  
- Basic OOP concepts  
- Control flow & loops  
- Beginner-level practice problems  

## Purpose
This is mainly for my **learning and revision**, but it’s open to everyone who wants to understand Kotlin from the basics.
